# password-generator

The password-generator is the 3rd homework of the bootcamp. 

We use html5, css3, and this is the first time we are using javascript in an assignment.

The password generator takes in from the user asking him/her how many characters they want from 8-128 for their password to be

then as they ask more questions about wether they want lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and numbers in the password. 

after they answer these questions their will be a randomly generated password on the screen.
